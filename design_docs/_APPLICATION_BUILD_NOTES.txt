2BHIP Website Designer Notes

If you have any questions or if I might've missed a few things, e-mail ray.villaraza@gmail.com

It may look like a lot of files, but it's just different views. Once you style the homepage's appViewTop and appViewBottom, you'd only be doing the "mainContentArea" of each page. :)

PHOTOSHOP: Folders with starting with a "+" indicate that it's a toggle to access a different view of the PSD, i.e. Pop-ups or New States


Fonts used: Google Fonts - Bangers and Open Sans

Colors:
- Blue #006099
- Red #be0000
- Orange #fb880d
- Yellow #ffcc00
- Black #000000
- Grays are #eeeeee, #cccccc

Animations: jQuery default setting for drop-downs, fades and slides, I believe it is called "swing". When products slide left/right as seen on the Main Banner or product groups, just use the "swing" animation.

Link Highlight/Hover specified in design, but button hover isn't. Buttons will start at a 90% transparency (still looks like it's in full-color), but goes up to 100% (vibrant) on hover. It's subtle, but should do.

Layout: Top bar and footer sections span 100% of browser width, the rest stay within a 960-grid.

Global Messaging resides in a Pop-up, pop-up template is in the PSDs, layer titled so.


*** Loading Page ***
- I've attached the ajax-loader.gif that goes with this page. Pretty straight forward, page should appear whenever the site is loading something.


*** Home Page ***
- Pretty straight forward as well, standard site framework.

- Main navigation (yellow-orange background) doesn't have a drop-down, it directs to "webDesign_2bhip_17-mainNavIndex_v2.jpg"

- Blue Navigation bar has a drop-down, can be accessed via "+" folder in the PSD

- Carousels will animated using standard jQuery "swing"

- Product Sizes buttons are interactive. When the user clicks on "S" or "M", he/she is taken to the Product Detail page of that selected size, i.e. have the size already pre-selected on entry to view the Product's Detail page.

- Added 2 "wait" gifs. To be placed on the button itself or next to (after or below) the buttons if there will be a significant loading time.


*** Categories Page ***
- Live sorting box on the left
- When updating the content delivered after using a a sort function, jQuery's fade in/out animation still using "swing"


*** Products Listings Page ***
- Live sorting box on the left
- When updating the content delivered after using a a sort function, jQuery's fade in/out animation still using "swing"


*** Product Detail Page ***
- Carousel function underneath the Product Image, clicking on the thumbnails enlarges it to the main panel (currently a red AC/DC shirt). Clicking on the main panel, enlarges the currently loaded image via lightbox to fit 80% screen width / height.

- Quantity is a left/right selector, user can adjust quantities this way.
